The following identifies pros and cons for running a Jitsi server

Pros
- complete privacy and control
- open source

Cons
- The recommended nginx server needs port 443, so you have to use a server which does not already utilize port 443
- must use Node Package Manager, aka 'npm'.  This is a security risk
- probably need to dedicate a server, e.g. a Virtual Machine on a Xen platform, just for this service
- project is Debian biased, so installation requires modification for Gentoo
